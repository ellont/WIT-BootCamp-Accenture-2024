The Friendly Forest Adventure
In a green forest, a little rabbit hopped along a winding path. She saw a tall tree with a round hole. Inside the hole lived a wise owl.
The rabbit and owl became friends. They decided to explore the forest together. They passed by a sparkling stream where fish swam.
Near the stream, they found a patch of colorful flowers. Butterflies danced around the petals. A big rock sat nearby, perfect for resting.
As the sun began to set, the friends saw a cozy cottage. Smoke rose from its chimney. They smelled fresh cookies baking inside.
The rabbit and owl said goodbye and returned to their homes. They looked forward to more adventures in their friendly forest.
